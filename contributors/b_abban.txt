Benjamin Abban
Benjamin Abban received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Civil Engineering from the Kwame 
Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), and the University of Cape Town, 
respectively.  He is currently pursuing a PhD degree in Civil and Environmental 
Engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, with emphasis on water 
resources under the supervision of Dr. Thanos Papanicolaou.  Prior to pursuing 
his PhD degree, he worked for four years as a consulting engineer for Aurecon, 
where he performed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses of riverine flows and hydraulic 
structures, as well as the design of water supply and drainage systems.  
He was also involved in the design and development of several water resources 
software, one of which was for managing environmental flow releases from the 
Berg River Dam.  His current research interests include upland erosion processes, 
watershed dynamics and scaling laws, knickpoint development and migration, and local 
scour around bridge piers and abutments.  He is also interested in computational 
modeling of river networks, as well as the use of various sensor technologies such 
as Radio Frequency IDs for monitoring land surfaces changes and sediment fluxes, 
for which he has recently co-filed a patent.  He is a National Science Foundation 
IGERT Fellow, and has received several scholarships and awards including the NASA 
Iowa Space Grant Consortium Scholarship, the Unilever Best Engineering Student 
award at KNUST and the West African Examination Councilâ€™s Best Student in the 
Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination.  He is a member of the American 
Geophysical Union, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the International 
Association of Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research, and the American Water 
Resources Association.
