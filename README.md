**DHARA** is an open source software for distributed hydrology and river analysis. We designed it to be optimal for hybrid CPU-GPU parallel computing. 

This project aims to provide a consistent framework for scientists to use and futher develop  modules for their modeling purposes. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code and contribute your model to the community.

Visit [http://hydrocomplexity.github.io/Dhara](http://hydrocomplexity.github.io/Dhara) to learn more information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The following packages are required to compile and run DHARA
```
mpich or openmpi
CUDA (5.0 or later)
netcdf4
```


### Download

Go to the folder you where you want to download Dhara, do:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:HydroComplexity/Dhara.git
```

### Installation
```
$ cd Dhara
$ make
```

## Documentation
Dhara model is developed based on a set of following research work: [Drewry et al. 2010a](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010JG001340/abstract), [Drewry et al. 2010b](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010JG001341/abstract), [Le et al. 2011](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/37/15085.abstract), [Quijano et al. 2012](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011WR011416/abstract), [Le et al. 2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815215300207).
